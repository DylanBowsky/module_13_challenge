# Neural Networks
The goal for this financial notebook is to make a comprehensive model that can correctly find the patterns in the data provided from both Venture firms. We are using the base code and after to see if we can enhance using or own techniques to the model.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Technologies Used
We used Jupyter notebook, sklearn, pandas, Tesnorflow, Keras, Sequential, OneHotEncoder, Path and StandarScaler.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation
We will need to install Tensorflow *can be pip install* and imports from sklearn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example
For these two notebooks we grabbed the base data from the CSV file given, and dropped the unwanted data. We cleaned the data up using OneHotEncoder trained and scaled the data. Once all of this is completed we ran the Sequential once with the base given and both hidden nodes in *relu* after that we thought of new ways to optimize the code to achieve a better accuarcy score. In some of the alternate models we got closer, but overall the base was the highest.
